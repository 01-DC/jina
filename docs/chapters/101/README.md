<h2 align="center">What is Jina?</h2>

<h2 align="center">How Does Jina Work?</h2>

Here we'll take a look at the big picture of how Jina works, and start diving deeper on each how all the parts work together.

<h3 align="center">Documents & Chunks</h3>

<img src="img/ILLUS1.png?raw=true" alt="Jina 101 Concept Document and Chunk, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina 101 Concept Document and Chunk, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="30%"/>

When most people think of search, they think of a bar you type words into, like Google. But search is much more than that - there's also voice, videos, music, code, locations, and many other things.

In Jina, we call all of these things **documents**. In short, a document is anything you want to search for, and the input query you use when searching.

Documents can be huge though - how can we search for the right part? If you search for a pancake recipe, you don't want to get the whole cookbook back! We do this by breaking a document into **chunks**. A chunk is a small semantic unit of a document, like a sentence, a 64x64 pixel image patch, or a pair of coordinates.

You can think of a Document like a chocolate bar. Documents have different formats and ingredients, but you can also break it into chunks any way you like. Eventually, what you buy and store are the chocolate bars, and what you eat and digest are the chunks. You don‚Äôt want to swallow the whole bar, but you don‚Äôt want to grind it into powder either; By doing that, you lose the flavor (i.e. the semantics).

<h3 align="center">Executors</h3>

<img align="left" src="img/ILLUS3.png?raw=true" alt="Jina AI Executor, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina AI Executor Concept, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="30%"/>

**Executors** are the worker bees of Jina, and represent an algorithmic unit. They do all the hard work like encoding images into vectors, storing vectors on disk, ranking results, and so on. Each executor has a simple interface, letting you concentrate on the algorithm and not get lost in the weeds. They feature persistence, scheduling, chaining, grouping, and parallelization out of the box.

The properties of an Executor are stored in a YAML config. They always go hand in hand.

<br/><br/><br/>

<h4 align="center">Executor Families</h4>

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/ILLUS4.png?raw=true" alt="Jina 101 Family of Executor, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina 101 Family of Executor, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="80%"/>
</p>

The **Executors** are a big family. Each family member focuses on one important aspect of the search system. Let‚Äôs meet:
- **Crafter**: for crafting/segmenting/transforming the Documents and Chunks;
- **Encoder**: for representing the Chunk as vector;
- **Indexer**: for saving and retrieving vectors and key-value information from storage;
- **Ranker**: for sorting results;

Got a new algorithm in mind? No problem, this family always welcomes new members!

<br/><br/>

<h3 align="center">Driver</h3>

<img align="right" src="img/ILLUS5.png?raw=true" alt="Jina 101 Driver, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina 101 Driver, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="30%"/>

Executors do all the hard work, but they're not great at talking to each other. A **Driver** helps them do this by defining how an Executor behaves to network requests. It interprets network traffic into a format the Executor can understand, for example translating Protobuf into a Numpy array.

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>



<h3 align="center">Peas</h3>

<img align="left" src="img/ILLUS6.png?raw=true" alt="Jina 101 Pea, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina 101 Pea, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="30%"/>

All healthy families need to communicate, and the Executor clan is no different. They talk to each other via Peas.

While a Driver translates data for an Executor, A **Pea** wraps an Executor and lets it exchange data over a network or with other Peas. Peas can also run in Docker, containing all dependencies and context in one place.

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h3 align="center">Pods</h3>

<img align="left" src="img/ILLUS8.png?raw=true" alt="Jina 101 Pod, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina 101 Pod, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="30%"/>

So now you've got lots of Peas talking to each other and rolling all over the place. How can you organize them? Nature uses **Pods**, and so do we.

A Pod is a group of Peas with the same property **Does this mean they perform the same task, or are different subtasks of one larger task?**, running in parallel on a local host or over the network. A Pod provides a single network interface for its Peas, making them look like one single Pea from the outside. Beyond that, a Pod adds further control, scheduling, and context management to the Peas.

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h3 align="center">Flow</h3>

<img align="left" src="img/ILLUS10.png?raw=true" alt="Jina 101 Flow, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina 101 Flow, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="30%"/>

Now we've got a garden full of pods, with each pod full of peas. That's a lot to manage! This is where **Flow** comes in. Flow is like a Pea plant. Just as a plant manages nutrient flow and growth rate for its branches, Flow manages the states and context of a group of Pods, orchestrating them to accomplish one task. Whether a Pod is remote or running in Docker, one Flow rules them all!

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<h3 align="center">Configuring Jina with YAML</h3>

<img align="right" src="img/ILLUS2.png?raw=true" alt="Jina 101 YAML, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" title="Jina 101 YAML Concept, Copyright by Jina AI Limited" hspace="10" width="30%"/>

Every part of Jina is configured with YAML files. In our chocolate bar chunking analogy, this would be the recipe for the chocolate bar. It might include:

* The type of chocolate - milk, dark, or white
* What it's used for - eating, cooking, drinking
* The size and weight of the bar

YAML files offer customization, allowing you to change the behavior of an object without touching its code. Jina can build a very complicated object directly from a simple YAML file, or save an object into a YAML file.

<h3 align="center">From Micro to Macro</h3>

Jina is one big happy family. You can feel the harmony when you use Jina.

You can design at the micro-level and scale up to the macro-level. YAMLs becomes algorithms, threads become processes, Pods become Flows. The patterns and logic always remain the same. This is the beauty of Jina.
