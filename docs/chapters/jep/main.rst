What is a JEP?
==============

JEP stands for Jina Enhancement Proposal. A JEP is a design document providing information to the JIna community, or describing a new feature for Jina or its processes or environment. The JEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We learn from the `PEP standard <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#what-is-a-pep>`_ and intend JEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. The PEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
