`jina` is *the* cloud-native semantic search solution powered by the state-of-the-art AI technology.


## Getting Started

The simplest way to use `jina` is via the Docker. We provide a universal Docker image as small as 100MB that can be run on multiple architectures (e.g. x64, x86, arm-64/v7/v6). Of course, you need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) first. 

### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina:master-debian
```

This command downloads the latest `jina` image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jinaai/jina/tags) based on your local architecture and then runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an help message and exits.

#### Github Package (Do not support multiarch)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN docker.pkg.github.com
docker run docker.pkg.github.com/jina-ai/jina/jina:[tag]
```

#### Tencent Cloud (Too slow to upload)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com
docker run ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/jina/jina:[tag]
```
</details>

### Run without Docker

If you prefer the classic way to run `jina` directly on the host without Docker, please make sure you have Python >= 3.7 installed on the host. 

#### Install from PyPi

To install the latest stable release:
 
```bash
pip install jina
```

#### Or, Install from This Git Repository

To install the latest master:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jina-ai/jina.git
```

#### Or, (Dev mode) Install from Your Local Folk/Clone 

For developers who want to edit the projectâ€™s code and test the changes on-the-fly, 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/jina
cd jina && pip install -e .
``` 

Note, if you later want to switch to the other ways of `jina` installation, remember to first uninstall your editable version from the system:

```bash
pip uninstall $(basename $(find . -name '*.egg-info') .egg-info)
```

## Test Your Installation

```bash
jina check
```

It prints a list of components the current `jina` supported and exits.

If you cloned this repository to local, then you can perform unittest via:

```bash
cd tests && python -m unittest *.py -v
```
  
## Documentation 

Documentation is built on every push, merge, and release event of the master branch. The generated HTML files are hosted in a separate repository: [`jina-ai/jina-docs`](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-docs)
 
To build the documentation locally, you need to have Docker installed. Clone this repository and run the following command: 

```bash
bash ./make-doc.sh serve 8080
```

The documentation is then available via browser at `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.
