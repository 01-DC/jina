Want to build a search system backed by deep learning? Then you come to the right place!

**Jina** is *the* cloud-native neural search framework powered by the state-of-the-art AI and deep learning. It is actively maintained by a full-time, [venture-backed team](https://jina.ai).

**üåå The Universal Search Solution** - Jina enables large-scale index and query of any kind on multiple platforms and architectures. Whether you are searching for images, video clips, audio snippets, long legal documents, short tweets, Jina can handle them all.

**üöÄ High Preformat & State-of-the-Art** - Jina aims at AI-in-production. You can easily scale out your VideoBERT, Xception, your word tokenizer, image segmenter and database to handle billion-level data. Features such as replicas and shards come off-the-shelf.

**üê£ System Engineering Made Easy** - Jina offers an one-stop solution that frees you from handcrafting and gluing packages, libraries and database. With the most intuitive API and [dashboard UI](https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard), building a cloud-native search system is just a minute thing.

**üß© Powerful Extensions, Simple Integration** - New AI model for Jina? Simply write a Python script or build a Docker image. Plugging in new algorithms has never been that easy, as it should be. Check out [Jina Hub (beta)](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-hub) and find more extensions on different use-cases contributed by the community.

Jina is an open-source project. [We are hiring](https://jina.ai/jobs) AI engineers, full-stack developers, evangelists, PMs to build *the* next neural search eco-system in open-source.

## Install

You can install or run Jina via PyPi or Docker container.

#### Install from PyPi
 
On Linux/MacOS with Python >= 3.7 installed, simply run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install jina
```

To install Jina with extra dependencies, or install it on Raspberry Pi please refer to the documentations.

#### ...or Run with Docker Container 

We provide a universal Jina image (only 80MB!) that supports multiple architectures (including x64, x86, arm-64/v7/v6), simply do: 

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina
```

## Jina "Hello, World!" üëãüåç

As a starter, we invite you to try Jina's "Hello, World" - a simple demo of image neural search for [Fashion-MNIST](https://hanxiao.io/2018/09/28/Fashion-MNIST-Year-In-Review/). No extra dependencies needed, simply do:

```bash
jina hello-world
```

...or even easier for Docker users, *no any install required*, simply:

```bash
docker run -v "$(PWD)/j:/j" jinaai/jina hello-world --workdir /j && open j/hello-world.html
```

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the console output</summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/chapters/helloworld/hello-world-demo.png?raw=true" alt="hello world console output">
</p>

</details>  

It downloads Fashion-MNIST training and test data and tells Jina to *index* 60,000 images from the training set. Then, it randomly samples images from the test set as *queries*, asks Jina to retrieve relevant results. After about 1 minute, it will open a webpage and show results like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

And the implementation behind? As simple as it should be:
