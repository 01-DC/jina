**Jina** is *the* cloud-native neural search solution powered by the state-of-the-art AI and deep learning technology.

Jina is an open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, [venture-backed team](https://jina.ai). We are hiring AI engineers, full-stack developers, evangelists, PMs to build *the* next neural search eco-system in open-source. 

**üåå The Universal Search Solution** - Jina enables large-scale index and query of any kind on multiple platforms and architectures. Whether you are searching for images, video clips, audio snippets, long legal documents, short tweets, Jina can handle them all.

**üöÄ High Preformat & State-of-the-Art** - Jina aims at AI-in-production. You can easily scale out your VideoBERT, Xception, your word tokenizer, image segmenter and database to handle billion-level data.

**üê£ System Engineering made Easy** - Jina offers an one-stop solution that frees you from handcrafting and gluing packages, libraries and database. With the most intuitive API and dashboard UI, building a cloud-native search system is just a minute thing.

**üß© Powerful Extensions, Simple Integration** - New AI model into Jina? Simply write a Python script or build a Docker image. Plugging in new algorithms has never been that easy, as it should be. Checkout Jina Hub (beta) and find more extensions on different use-cases made by the community.

## Install

You can install or run Jina via PyPi or Docker container.

#### Install from PyPi
 
On Linux/MacOS with Python >= 3.7 installed, simply run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install jina
```

To install Jina with extra dependencies, or install it on Raspberry Pi and other Linux system, please refer to the documentations.

#### ...or Run with Docker Container 

We provide a universal Jina image (only 80MB!) that can be run on multiple architectures (e.g. x64, x86, arm-64/v7/v6), simply do: 

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina
```

## Jina "Hello, World!"

As a starter, we invite you to try Jina's "Hello, World": a simple demo of image neural search for [Fashion-MNIST](https://hanxiao.io/2018/09/28/Fashion-MNIST-Year-In-Review/). No more extra dependencies, simply do:

```bash
jina hello-world
```

For Docker users:

```bash
docker run -v "$(PWD)/j:/j" jinaai/jina:devel hello-world --workdir /j --logserver && open j/hello-world.html
```

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the console output</summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/hello-world-demo.svg" alt="hello world console output">
</p>

</details>  

This downloads Fashion-MNIST training and test sets and tells Jina *indexes* 60,000 images from the training set. Then, it randomly samples images from the test set as *queries*, asks Jina to retrieve relevant results. All big words you can name: computer vision, neural IR, microservice, message queue, elastic, replicas & shards happened in just one minute!

After 1 minute, it will open a webpage and show results like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/hello-world.gif?raw=true" alt="Jina banner" width="90%">
</p>

And the implementation behind? As simple as it should be:

<table>
<tr>
<td> Python API </td>
<td>

```python
from jina.flow import Flow

f = Flow().load_config('index.yml')
with f.build() as fl:
    fl.index(raw_bytes=input_fn)
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <pre>index.yml</pre> </td>
<td>

```yaml
!Flow
pods:
  chunk_seg:
    yaml_path: helloworld.crafter.yml
    replicas: $REPLICAS
    read_only: true
  doc_idx:
    yaml_path: helloworld.indexer.doc.yml
  encode:
    yaml_path: helloworld.encoder.yml
    needs: chunk_seg
    replicas: $REPLICAS
  chunk_idx:
    yaml_path: helloworld.indexer.chunk.yml
    replicas: $SHARDS
    separated_workspace: true
  join_all:
    yaml_path: _merge
    needs: [doc_idx, chunk_idx]
    read_only: true
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


Intrigued? Play with different arguments via:

```bash
jina hello-world --help
```

## Documentation 

The generated HTML files are hosted in [`jina-ai/jina-docs`](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-docs).

Documentation is built on every push, merge, and release event of the master branch. 
 
To build the documentation locally, you need to have Docker installed. Clone this repository and run the following command: 

```bash
bash ./make-doc.sh serve 8080
```

The documentation is then available via browser at `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.
