Jina is *the* cloud-native semantic search solution powered by SOTA AI technology.


## Getting Started

The simplest way to run Jina is via the docker container. 

### Run with docker image

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN docker.pkg.github.com
docker run docker.pkg.github.com/jina-ai/jina/jina:master-debian
```

This command downloads the latest Jina image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an help message and exits.


If you want to run Jina without Docker, please make sure you have Python 3.7 installed. 
If you are using `pyenv` for controlling the Python virtual environment, make sure the Jina codebase is covered by `pyenv local 3.7.x`
