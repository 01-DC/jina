Jina is *the* cloud-native semantic search solution powered by the state-of-the-art AI technology.


## Getting Started

The simplest way to run Jina is via the Docker container.  

### Run within a Docker Container

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina:master-debian
```

This command downloads the latest Jina image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jinaai/) and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an help message and exits.

#### Github Package (Do not support multiarch)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN docker.pkg.github.com
docker run docker.pkg.github.com/jina-ai/jina/jina:[tag]
```

#### Tencent Cloud (Too slow to upload)

```bash
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com
docker run ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/jina/jina:[tag]
```
</details>

### Run without Docker

If you prefer the classic way to run Jina without Docker, please make sure you have Python 3.7 installed on the host. 

If you are using `pyenv` for controlling the Python virtual environment, make sure the Jina codebase is covered by `pyenv local 3.7.x`

#### Install from PyPi
 
```bash
pip install jina
jina --help
```

#### Install from This Git Repository

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jina-ai/jina.git
jina --help
```

#### (Dev mode) Install from Your Local Folk/Clone 

For developers who want to edit the projectâ€™s code and test the changes on-the-fly, 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/jina
cd jina && pip install -e .
jina --help
``` 

To uninstall your local version:

```bash
pip uninstall $(basename $(find . -name '*.egg-info') .egg-info)
```

  
## Documentation 

Documentation is built by Sphinx triggered by the push, merge, and release event on the master branch. The generated docs are available at https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-docs
 
To build the documentation locally, you need to have Docker installed. Clone this repository and run the following command: 
```bash
bash ./make-doc.sh serve 8080
```

The documentation is then available via browser at `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.
